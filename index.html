  GUI Assignment: Creating Your First Web Page
  Daury Argueta, UMass Lowell Computer Science, daury_argueta@student.uml.edu 

  purpose: The purpose of this assignment was to get familiar with HTML and CSS. I had to understand how HTML correlated with
  CSS. With CSS, you can control the color, font, the size of text, the spacing between elements, how elements are positioned and laid out,
   what background images or background colors are to be used, different displays for different devices and screen sizes. I had to use the
   Basic HTML 5 and had to include tables, images, lines, color and different kinds of fonts in the page. I had to differentiate each tag
   and see when it is proper to use each.

      <p>
        My name is Daury Argueta and I was born and raised in Boston
        Massachusetts. My family is originally from Guatemala and came to the
        United States in the 1990's. I really enjoy photography, and here is a
        picture that I took of the sunset in Boston in 2019.

    <div class="piano">
      <p>
        I started to play the piano when I was 5 years old. It all started by
        the curiousity of tapping the keys of the piano that was gifted to my
        sister when my passion and love for playing the piano started. Till this
        day I play for my church and try teach people there as well.

    <div class="animals">
      <p>
        I love animals. Every since I have been a little boy a dog or a cat has
        been my side. I do not only love Cats and Dogs but animals as a whole.
        They mean alot to me because I find them so pure and sincere. This is a
        image where I took a friends dog for a walk while he was away.
